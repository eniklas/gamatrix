[![CI](https://github.com/eniklas/gamatrix-gog/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eniklas/gamatrix-gog/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Quick start

Jump to [command-line mode](#command-line-mode) or [building with Docker](#running-in-docker).

## Introduction

gamatrix-gog is a tool to compare the games owned by several users, and list all the games they have in common. Since GOG Galaxy supports almost all major digital distribution platforms through integrations, it's a great service for aggregating most of your games in one place. gamatrix-gog uses the sqlite database that GOG Galaxy stores locally to pull its data from; this generally means you'll need to get a copy of the DB from each of your friends to compare them. The upside is that you don't need to do any authentication or worry about your friends making their profiles public; the downside is that the data is only as current as the DBs you have.

The name comes from [gamatrix](https://github.com/d3r3kk/gamatrix), another tool for comparing games. This project may eventually be integrated into it.

## Usage

```pre
usage: gamatrix-gog.py [-h] [-a] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-d] [-i INTERFACE]
                       [-p PORT] [-s] [-u [USERID [USERID ...]]]
                       [db [db ...]]

Show games owned by multiple users.

positional arguments:
  db                    the GOG DB for a user; multiple can be listed

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a, --all-games       list all games owned by the selected users
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        the config file to use
  -d, --debug           debug output
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        the network interface to use if running in server
                        mode; defaults to 0.0.0.0
  -p PORT, --port PORT  the network port to use if running in server mode;
                        defaults to 8080
  -s, --server          run in server mode
  -u [USERID [USERID ...]], --userid [USERID [USERID ...]]
                        the GOG user IDs to compare
```

`db`: a GOG database to use. You can usually find a user's DB in `C:\ProgramData\GOG.com\Galaxy\storage\galaxy-2.0.db`. Multiple DBs can be listed. Not compatible with `-u`.

`-a/--all-games`: list all the games owned by the selected users (user selection is covered below). This is useful when you want to add a game to the [config file](#configuration), as you'll need the exact title as listed by this option.

`-c/--config-file`: the YAML config file to use. You don't need a config file, but you'll likely want one. See [configuration](#configuration) for details.

`-d/--debug`: enable debug messages. Generally only useful for development.

`-s/--server`: run in server mode. This will use Flask to serve a small web page where you can select the options you want, and will output the results there.

`-u/--userid`: a list of GOG user IDs to compare. The IDs must be in the [config file](#configuration). You can find the user ID by running `sqlite3 /path/to/galaxy-2.0.db "select * from Users;"`. If you use this option, you can't list DBs; they must be provided for the user IDs in the config file.

### Command-line mode

Command-line mode is mostly useful for debugging. It lists the matching games, but doesn't include any of the other data that server mode provides (platform, comments, etc.). To run, clone this repo and:

**1. Setup your virtual environment:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

_For our Windows friends:_

```pwsh
py -3 -m venv venv
.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./gamatrix-gog.py
```

**Note:** Python 3.7+ is recommended. Dictionaries are assumed to be ordered, which is a 3.7+ feature.

### Server mode

If you use the `-s` option or set `mode: server` in the [config file](#configuration), a Flask web server is started and runs until the script is killed. This serves a web page with a check box for all users defined in the config file; users can select who they want to compare and a table is generated for the matching games. There is also a game grid layout that shows all games with color-coded cells indicating who owns which games.

Server mode is the intended use case, and supports all options, unlike CLI mode, which may not.

## Configuration

A YAML file provides the runtime configuration; by default, this is `config.yaml` in the same directory as the script, but this can be overridden with the `-c` option. See the annotated [sample file](config-sample.yaml) or the [Windows flavour of this file](config-sample-windows.yaml) for an explanation of the format.

## Running in Docker

A [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided for running gamatrix-gog in a container. Build it with:

```bash
docker build -t gamatrix-gog .
```

Then run it:

**Linux/MacOS:**

```bash
docker run -d --name gamatrix-gog -p 8080:80/tcp -v /path/to/gog_dbs:/usr/src/app/gog_dbs -v /path/to/config.yaml:/usr/src/app/config/config.yaml gamatrix-gog
```

**Windows:**

```pwsh
C:\Users\me> docker --name gamatrix-gog -p 8080:80/tcp -v C:\Users\me\dev\gamatrix-gog-dbs:/usr/src/app/gog_dbs -v C:\Users\me\dev\gamatrix-gog\derek-config.yaml:/usr/src/app/config/config.yaml gamatrix-gog
```

Now you should be able to access the web page. If not, use `docker logs` to see what went wrong. The DBs are read on every call, so you can update them and they'll be used immediately. If you change the config file you'll need to restart the container for it to take effect.

### Restricting access

Flask is not a production-grade web server, and some people may not like their GOG DBs being exposed to the open Internet (I'm not aware of anything more personal in there than user IDs and game info, but I have not exhaustively checked by any means, so better safe than sorry). If you want to make the service only accessible to your friends, you can do this with iptables. I use Ubuntu 18.04, so YMMV:

Create a new chain called gamatrix:

```pre
# iptables -N gamatrix
```

Allow access to your friends' IPs, and your own internal network:

```pre
# for cidr in 192.168.0.0/24 1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8; do iptables -A gamatrix --src $cidr -j ACCEPT ; done
```

Drop everyone else that tries to reach gamatrix-gog (be sure to use the right port):

```pre
# iptables -A gamatrix -m tcp -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP
```

Finally, insert your new chain into the `DOCKER-USER` chain:

```pre
# iptables -I DOCKER-USER 1 -j gamatrix
```

You final configuration should look like this:

```pre
# iptables -L DOCKER-USER
Chain DOCKER-USER (1 references)
target     prot opt source               destination
gamatrix   all  --  anywhere             anywhere
RETURN     all  --  anywhere             anywhere

# iptables -L gamatrix
Chain gamatrix (1 references)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  192.168.0.0/24       anywhere
ACCEPT     all  --  1.2.3.4              anywhere
ACCEPT     all  --  5.6.7.8              anywhere
DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http
```

Save it so it persists after reboot:

```pre
# apt install iptables-persistent
# iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

Now you can open the port on your router. For more information on using iptables with Docker, see [here](https://docs.docker.com/network/iptables/).
